    "# Context\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we explained how the training process works and how to evaluate our models in the classification framework. We built four models that predicted whether a user would consume content within a two-week period based upon their past behaviour over the previous 14 weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting whether or not a given user will return is very useful; it provides valuable insight and feedback on the way we are surfacing content to our users and, in particular,  identifies the users where we need to do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data on the engagement of returning audience members is also useful. From the pool of audience members that did return, there will be valuable variation in the amount of content they consume. The aim of this current tutorial is to forecast the _quantity_ of content consumed by an audience member within a two-week period, based upon their consumption behaviour in the previous weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to forecast the minutes watched within the final two-week group we will first define our evaluation metric. As we did for the classifiers in the previous tutorial, we will then train different models, compare their performances to a baseline and benchmark their results. \n",

    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of a regressor is slightly less straightforward than a classifier although it is based upon the same principle: we define an error, then compare the error of our model to the expected error of a baseline model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For regressors, the error is computed as the average residual between the actual observations and the model predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Root mean squared error_ (RMSE) and _mean absolute error_ (MAE) are two commonly used examples of these. Once we have a representation of the error produced by the model we can compare that error with the error of the most simple model of the data (usually the mean). The statistic that reflects this difference is known as the coefficient of determination, or _R-squared_. R-squared measures the _goodness-of-fit_ of a model and can be thought of as the proportion of variance in the model output y that is captured by our model. In order to control for the complexity of the regressions we usually consider the _Adjusted R-squared_. We won't compute any of these statistics here but it's a good exercice for the reader.\n",

So, users that consume most iPlayer content on Wednesdays, or in the afternoon, or whose favourite genre is Sport are more likely to consume more content overall. Conversely, users whose favourite genre is Children's or who consume most of their content on a Monday do not consume - in terms of total of minutes - as much. It's difficult to speak of drivers for engagement here because the minutes watched is highly correlated to the type of content. For example, Children's  content is, on average, shorter than Sport or Drama so it makes sense that people that watch long shows watch more minutes than people that watch short shows. It doesn't necessarily mean than the user's who consume only Children's content are less engaged. \n",

    "- We learnt about the concept of _regularization_; an approach that aims to reduce the problem of very large coefficients in regression models which can lead to overfitting.\n",

    "Over the four tutorials in this course we have covered a lot. You may not feel like an expert data science yet but if you're starting to feel comfortable with everything we have done so far you are certainly on your way there. \n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, the first tutorial helped us understand how to _formulate our data science problem_ and select the dataset we need to solve it. We decided that it would be useful to try and predict engagement statistics of users within a two-week period, based upon their viewing behaviour in the previous 14 weeks. To solve this problem we decided to use a dataset containing the views of 10,000 iPlayer viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second tutorial we introduced the concept of _data wrangling_; transforming and preparing our dataset so that it is ready to be ingested into our statistical learning models. It is these models that allow us to make engagement predictions and forecasts about our users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third tutorial, we were introduced to our first _classifier models_; how to train them and how to evaluate their performance. We used four classifiers to forecast whether or not a user was _engaged_ with iPlayer, in a sense that he or she will consume content on the last two-week group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final tutorial, we introduced our first _regression models_. These allowed us to forecast the amount of engagement with iPlayer content. Finally, we combine the two type of modeling to get the most of our data and the patterns found in it. \n",
