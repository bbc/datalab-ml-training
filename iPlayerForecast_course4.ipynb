    "# Context\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we explained how the training process works and how to evaluate our models in the classification framework. We built few models to predict whether a user will consume content on the last two-week group based on his past behaviour on the 7 two-week groups before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting if a user will consume content is very usefull. It allows for example to focus our efforts on the ones who are not likely to come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The users who are likely to come back within the last two-week period might also have different levels of engagement. Understanding to what extent they will consume content is key for the BBC to personnalise their experience with the product.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to forecast the minutes watched within the next two-week group we will first define our evaluation metric. As for the classifier, we will then try different models and compare their performances to a baseline. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='model_evaluation'></a>\n",
    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For regressors, the evaluation of the model is less straightforward and is usually based upon the average residual between the actual observations and the model predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Root mean squared error__ (RMSE) and __mean absolute error__ (MAE) are two commonly used examples of these. Once we have a representation of the error produced by the model we can compare that error with the error of the most simple model of the data (usually the mean). This statistic is known as the coefficient of determination or __R-squared__ and represents the part of variability the model managed to get.\n",

    "The results are quite interesting here. It seems that some particular habits __drive__ the amount of content consumed. User that consume content on iPlayer most of the time on Wednesdays, or in the afternoon, or whose favourite genre is News are likely to consume more content (positive coefficients). On the other side, users whose favourite genre is Children's won't consume - in terms of total of minutes - much. It's difficult to speak of drivers for _engagement_ here because the minutes watched is highly correlated to the type of content. Children's pieces of content are on average shorter than Sport or Drama ones. It doesn't mean than the user's who consume only Children's content are less engaged. \n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated coefficients can be interpreted as follow: for the `num_genre` variable, the estimated contribution is 1,3. All other thing being equal (favourite genre \"Drama\", favourite time of the day \"Evening\" etc.), consuming one other genre in the past weeks will make the user consume 1,3mn more within the two following weeks. While this is certainly a bit far-fetched, looking at the sign of the coefficient is a good sanity check. For example we won't expect the number of different genre consumed to lower engagement.\n",
