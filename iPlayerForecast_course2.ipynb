    "In the previous tutorial we formulated a data problem, chose a dataset and performed some initial steps that cleaned  and then helped us explore the structure of our data. In this second course we will start looking at how to _prepare_ our dataset to be compatible with the kind of statistical models that can help us solve our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation or _data wrangling_ is a crucial step in the modelling process. It refers to how we create a dataset to be ingested into at least one of the many statistical models at our disposal. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make sure we understand the scope of the problem:\n",
    "- Do we have a _target_ variable? In other words, will our model predict something (the target) or will it look for unlabeled structure? (supervised vs unsupervised models)\n",
    "- If predicting, what form will the prediction target have? Is it represented as discrete categories or a linear scale (classification or regression)?\n",
    "- If predicting, what is the granularity? User level? User x time level?\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we dive back into the code, let's explain a few core concepts that will be helpful to understand before we go any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='supervised_vs_unsupervised'></a>\n",
    "# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "An important disctinction to make when preparing your data for analysis is whether your problem is suitable for “supervised” or “unsupervised” learning models. \n",
    " \n",
    "__Unsupervised learning__ models receive input (_explanatory/predictor/independent_ variables or _features_) but no output (or _dependent/target_ variable)  and are a way of discovering latent structure in a set of data (clustering is an example of unsupervised learning). Unsupervised models are very useful when working with unlabelled datasets. These models can then be (and often are) combined with supervised models.\n",
    " \n",
    "__Supervised learning__ models learn a mathematical function between an input (_explanatory/predictor/independent_ variables) and an output (the _dependent/target_ variable). These models are used in situations where you know what you want to predict and have explicit input-output pairs for your model to be trained upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current project we want to forecast the minutes watched on iPlayer (output or _target_ variable) based on past behavior (input or _explanatory/predictor/independent_ variables). We have input-output pairs and are, therefore, in the supervised learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='classif_vs_reg'></a>\n",
    "# Classification vs Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the supervised learning class of problems there is a further split, based upon the nature of the target variable: discrete or linear. If a dataset is being used to predict one of a finite set of categories, this is called a classification problem and is tackled by a specific set of models called _classifiers_. A simple example of a classification problem is a spam email filter where the text of the email must be classified as either legitimate or not. A further exampleof a _multi-classification_ problem is handwriting recognition, where a hand-written letter is classified as one of a set of 36 (26 letters and 10 digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, some data problems require the prediction of linear or non-categorical variables. This class of problems is approached using a class of model called _regressors_. An example of a regression problem would be to predict the number of hits an article receives by analysing the contents of its headline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current project we want to predict if a user watched any content within a two-week period (a classification problem), and we also want to know _how much_ content a user watched within a two-week period (a regression problem). We will therefore be using both classifiers and regressors in this project.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we will walk through the process of how to select and calculate input to our model. The input to a statistical model can often be confusing as it can be described in many different ways. _Independent variables, explanatory variables, predictor variables_ and _features_ are all ways of describing the same thing: the input to your statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='feature_selection'></a>\n",
    "## Feature Selection\n",
    "As mentioned in the first course, in most situations the process of selecting our input or _feature engineering_ is an iterative one until you get the feature set that neither _underfits_ or _overfits_ the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature set that does not contain sufficient information about the output variable will often result in the model underfitting (this can usually be identified by a high _training error_). The solution here is often to add more features. If the feature set contains features that are sensitive to spurious and random elements of the dataset (and not the underlying population it should be an approximation of), _overfitting_ occurs. Overfitting is characterised by low _training error_ and high _test error_. Overfitting can be tackled by reducing the complexity of your model (often removing features) or using regularisation techniques (https://www.quora.com/What-is-regularization-in-machine-learning). A larger and more diverse training set also helps to reduce overfitting. We will come back to the concept of training and test errors in the following course.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various feature selection tools that can be used together with cross-validation to optimise your feature set (e.g. _stepwise regression_ - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression).  \n",
    " \n",
    "In our project we choose to focus on features that describe the viewing habits of a particular user (e.g. “average completion”, “most watched genre”, ”time watched“).\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Granularity\n",
    "The input variables for regression and classifications models are no different here, so we will perform the same process for each. Just as for our target variable, our input variables must have a `user_id` granularity (i.e. each must be paired with a unique audience member).\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. As our dataset contains temporal properties, we could have performed a more granular pivot on `user_id x twoweek` (i.e. a user represented as seven rows - one for each two-week group). Splitting the dataset up in this way, allows certain types of model to exploit any temporal contingencies that may exist in the data. To keep things simple, here we stick to a single row per user."

Correlation is a statistical test which measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient is a value between -1 and 1. Variables that are perfectly correlated or perfectly inversely-correlated  have coefficients of 1 and -1 respectively. Variables that have no linear relationship will have a coeffient of zero. A correlation matrix calculates coefficients for every pair of variable and illustrates them _n_ x _n_ grid (where n= the number of features). \n",
