    "Cultivating brand loyalty is key for the BBC to remain relevant in a data-driven world dominated by the likes of Youtube, Netflix and Facebook. We know that tens of thousands of viewers consume our content on iPlayer everyday but we still have very little understanding of what makes them come back for more. In order to keep our audience engaged, it is vital that we develop audience statistics that reflect how likely they are to continue consuming our content. These metrics will then enable us to gain greater insights into whether we are surfacing the right content to the right audience members. These activities will be vital for retaining and growing our audiences both domestically and around the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Formulation\n",
    "One way of measuring the engagement of a user is to count how much content they have consumed over a given period.  Engagement, measured in this way, may be affected by many different factors ranging from the kind of content they enjoy to the time of day they consume it.\n",
    " \n",
    "In our current exercise, what we want to understand is how an audience member consumes content, based upon their past behaviour. More specifically, what we will do in this case is to investigate if there is a relationship between an audience member’s viewing behaviour (what and when they have watched on iPlayer) over a 14-week period and the amount of content they consumed in the subsequent two-week period.\n",

To ensure that any inferences you make from your dataset can be generalised to “the real world” it is important to ensure that the data you choose for your dataset is indeed a good representation of the wider population it is sampled from and, in particular, free from systematic biases. Regardless of what machine-learning techniques you eventually use, if your dataset is not a good approximation of the population it is supposed to represent, you will struggle to find a satisfactory solution to your problem.\n",

    "Feature engineering is the process of identifying the input variables (_time of the day, content genre_ etc.) that will be used by your model to predict the output variable (_number of minutes watched_). Feature engineering is _very_ important as the performance of your model is directly dependent upon the features you choose as input. Statistical models are essentially just pattern detectors. Different types of models have strengths and weaknesses in specific situations but they can only find structure in your data if the information exists in your features, in the first place.\n",

    "In most situations the process of feature engineering is an iterative one. Finding the best subset of explanatory variables is not straightforward and we will come back to this later. In the meantime, we will enhance the data by calculating some additional features that we think can help predict the viewing-time of iPlayer users. \n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have our dataset, enhanced with some additional features we can start its exploration. First of all, we need to check the quality of the data we are working with. Most data sources are very \"noisy\"; often data is missing for some observations or data can also be wrong. It is therefore crucial to spend some time cleaning the data to avoid a \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem. Cleaning involves both inferring _missing values_ and identifying _outliers_ (statistically improbable values). When dealing with missing or unusual values, always keep in mind the \"business\" and context of your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the investigation and enrichment of data is quite a cyclical process. As you investigate the data you have new ideas on how to fix and enrich it and you will then again check whether you have any missing or clearly wrong values in your dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis also allows us to get a _feel_ for our dataset and provides useful insights regarding the best techniques or models to use later on in the modelling stage. Data exploration can involve many different techniques and approaches but will invariably include generating _descriptive statistics_ and _visualising distributions_. Summarising our data in this way is not only useful for checking the assumptions that many models hold about our data but can also be useful to perform _coherence_ (or _confidence_) checks when evaluating the output of the more complex models we use later on.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that by imputing data into empty fields we are almost always making assumptions about the structure of the data. These assumptions can be more or less valid. For example, to impute genre, we may choose series ID or we may choose broadcast hour. If we impute from series ID we are making the assumption that all programs within a specific series will have the same genre. Alternatively, if we impute from broadcast hour we are assuming that all shows broadcast at a specific hour of the day are the same genre. You must judge for yourself whether these assumptions are valid or not. \n",
    " \n",
    "Since the field `genre` has only a small number of possible values but quite a large number of missing values, we will start by imputing it to reduce the amount of missing data. After that the most useful column to impute is probably `programme_duration`, again because it is quite easy to impute and will remove a fair amount of missing data. \n",
